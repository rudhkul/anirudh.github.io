      <description>&amp;ldquo;I will buy you the toy car on your birthday, Varun,&amp;rdquo; yelled Mumma.
&amp;ldquo;But,&amp;rdquo; Varun tried to reason with her.
&amp;ldquo;What has Mumma told you to do when she is working?&amp;rdquo; Mumma bristled with rage while continuously typing a mail to her colleague.
&amp;ldquo;Do - not - disturb,&amp;rdquo; Varun replied to the floor and walked away while folding his hands as if he&amp;rsquo;s trying to contain his anger.
During the dinner, there was an awkward silence.</description>
